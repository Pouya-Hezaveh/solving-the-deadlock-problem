# The Deadlock Problem
In an operating system, a deadlock occurs when a process or thread enters a waiting state because a requested system resource is held by another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource held by another waiting process.

In this project, we've solved the problem by preventing any circular-waiting states to happen.

This was done two years ago, before I committed it here.
